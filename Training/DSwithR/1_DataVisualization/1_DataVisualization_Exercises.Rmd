# Exercises for the Data Visualization Presentation

1. Run ggplot(data = mpg). What do you see?

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg)
```

2. How many rows are in mpg? How many columns?

```{r}

```

3. What does the drv variable describe? Read the help for ?mpg to find out.

```{r}

```

4. Make a scatterplot of hwy vs cyl.

```{r}

```

5. What happens if you make a scatterplot of class vs drv? Why is the plot not useful?

```{r}

```

6. Whatâ€™s gone wrong with this code? Why are the points not blue?
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = "blue"))
```

7. Which variables in mpg are categorical? Which variables are continuous? (Hint: type ?mpg to read the
documentation for the dataset). How can you see this information when you run mpg?

```{r}

```

8. Map a continuous variable to color, size, and shape. How do these aesthetics behave differently for
categorical vs. continuous variables?

```{r}

```

9. What happens if you map the same variable to multiple aesthetics?

```{r}

```

10. What does the stroke aesthetic do? What shapes does it work with? (Hint: use ?geom_point)

This vignette may provide some answers.

[Aesthetic Specifications](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/vignettes/ggplot2-specs.html)

```{r}

```

11. What happens if you map an aesthetic to something other than a variable name, like aes(colour =
displ < 5)?

```{r}

```

12.  What happens if you facet on a continuous variable?

13.  What do the empty cells in plot with `facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)` mean?
    How do they relate to this plot?
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    ggplot(data = mpg) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = drv, y = cyl))
    ```

14.  What plots does the following code make? What does `.` do?

    ```{r eval = FALSE}
    ggplot(data = mpg) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
      facet_grid(drv ~ .)
    
    ggplot(data = mpg) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
      facet_grid(. ~ cyl)
    ```

15.  Take the first faceted plot in this section:

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    ggplot(data = mpg) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
      facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)
    ```
    
    What are the advantages to using faceting instead of the colour aesthetic?
    What are the disadvantages? How might the balance change if you had a 
    larger dataset?
    
16.  Read `?facet_wrap`. What does `nrow` do? What does `ncol` do? What other
    options control the layout of the individual panels? Why doesn't
    `facet_grid()` have `nrow` and `ncol` argument?

17.  When using `facet_grid()` you should usually put the variable with more
    unique levels in the columns. Why?
    
18.  What geom would you use to draw a line chart? A boxplot? 
    A histogram? An area chart?

19.  Run this code in your head and predict what the output will look like.
    Then, run the code in R and check your predictions.
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) + 
      geom_point() + 
      geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
    ```

20.  What does `show.legend = FALSE` do?  What happens if you remove it?  
    Why do you think I used it earlier in the chapter?

21.  What does the `se` argument to `geom_smooth()` do?


22.  Will these two graphs look different? Why/why not?

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
      geom_point() + 
      geom_smooth()
    
    ggplot() + 
      geom_point(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
      geom_smooth(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
    ```

23.  Recreate the R code necessary to generate the following graphs.

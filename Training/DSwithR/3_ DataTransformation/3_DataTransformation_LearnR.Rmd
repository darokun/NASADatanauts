Visualization is an important tool for insight generation, but it is rare that you get the data in exactly the
right form you need. Often you’ll need to create some new variables or summaries, or maybe you just want
to rename the variables or reorder the observations in order to make the data a little easier to work with.
You’ll learn how to do all that (and more!), next we will look at how to transform your data
using the dplyr package and a new dataset on flights departing New York City in 2013.



## Get Started


## Prerequisites

We’re going to focus on how to use the dplyr package, another core member of the tidyverse.
We’ll illustrate the key ideas using data from the nycflights13 package, and use ggplot2 to help us understand
the data.

```{r tidy=FALSE}
library(nycflights13)
library(tidyverse)
```

Take careful note of the conflicts message that’s printed when you load the tidyverse. It tells you that dplyr
overwrites some functions in base R. If you want to use the base version of these functions after loading
dplyr, you’ll need to use their full names: `stats::filter()` and `stats::lag()`.

## nycflights13

To explore the basic data manipulation verbs of dplyr, we’ll use **nycflights13::flights**. This data frame
contains all 336,776 flights that departed from New York City in 2013. The data comes from the US Bureau
of Transportation Statistics, and is documented in ?flights.

**Note:** tibbles are data frames tweaked to work better in the tidyverse.

## Dplyr Basics

You are going to learn the five key dplyr functions that allow you to solve the vast majority
of your data manipulation challenges:

1. Pick observations by their values (**filter()**).
1. Reorder the rows (**arrange()**).
1. Pick variables by their names (**select()**).
1. Create new variables with functions of existing variables (**mutate()**).
1. Collapse many values down to a single summary (**summarise()**).

These can all be used in conjunction with group_by() which changes the scope of each function from
operating on the entire dataset to operating on it group-by-group. These six functions provide the verbs for
a language of data manipulation

## How They Work

All verbs work similarly:
1. The first argument is a data frame.
2. The subsequent arguments describe what to do with the data frame, using the variable names (without
quotes).
3. The result is a new data frame.

## Filter

**filter()** allows you to subset observations based on their values.

When you run that line of code, dplyr executes the filtering operation and returns a new data frame.

```{r}
filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
```


You can store the results in a new data frame object you create like this:

```{r}
jan1 <- filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
```

R either prints out the results, or saves them to a variable. If you want to do both, you can wrap the assignment in parentheses:

```{r}
(dec25 <- filter(flights, month == 12, day == 25))
```

## Comparisons

To use filtering effectively, you have to know how to select the observations 
that you want using the comparison operators. R provides the standard suite:
`>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `!=` (not equal), and `==` (equal). 

When you're starting out with R, the easiest mistake to make is to use `=` 
instead of `==` when testing for equality. When this happens you'll get an informative error:

```{r, error = TRUE}
filter(flights, month = 1)
```

## Logical Operators

Multiple arguments to `filter()` are combined with "and": every expression must 
be true in order for a row to be included in the output. For other types of 
combinations, you'll need to use Boolean operators yourself: `&` is "and", `|` 
is "or", and `!` is "not".

![Logical Operators](images/transform-logical.png)

The following code finds all flights that departed in November or December:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
filter(flights, month == 11 | month == 12)
```
You can’t write **filter(flights, month == 11 | 12)**

Try it, see what you get.

A useful short-hand for this problem is x %in% y. This will select every row 
where x is one of the values in y. We could use it to rewrite the code above:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
nov_dec <- filter(flights, month %in% c(11, 12))
```

Sometimes you can simplify complicated subsetting by remembering De Morgan's law:
`!(x & y)` is the same as `!x | !y`, and `!(x | y)` is the same as `!x & !y`. 
For example, if you wanted to find flights that weren't delayed (on arrival or 
departure) by more than two hours, you could use either of the following two filters:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
filter(flights, !(arr_delay > 120 | dep_delay > 120))
filter(flights, arr_delay <= 120, dep_delay <= 120)
```

## Missing Values

One important feature of R that can make comparison tricky are missing values, 
or `NA`s ("not availables"). `NA` represents an unknown value so missing values 
are "contagious": almost any operation involving an unknown value will also be unknown.

```{r}
NA > 5
10 == NA
NA + 10
NA / 2
```

If you want to determine if a value is missing, use `is.na()`:

```{r}
x <- NA
is.na(x)
```

`filter()` only includes rows where the condition is `TRUE`; it excludes both `FALSE` and `NA` values. If you want to preserve missing values, ask for them explicitly:

```{r}
df <- tibble(x = c(1, NA, 3))
filter(df, x > 1)
filter(df, is.na(x) | x > 1)
```

## Arrange

`arrange()` works similarly to `filter()` except that instead of selecting rows, it changes their order. It takes a data frame and a set of column names (or more complicated expressions) to order by. If you provide more than one column name, each additional column will be used to break ties in the values of preceding columns:

```{r}
arrange(flights, year, month, day)
```

Use `desc()` to re-order by a column in descending order:

```{r}
arrange(flights, desc(arr_delay))
```

Missing values are always sorted at the end:

```{r}
df <- tibble(x = c(5, 2, NA))
arrange(df, x)
arrange(df, desc(x))
```

## Select

It's not uncommon to get datasets with hundreds or even thousands of variables. 
In this case, the first challenge is often narrowing in on the variables you're
actually interested in. `select()` allows you to rapidly zoom in on a useful 
subset using operations based on the names of the variables.

`select()` is not terribly useful with the flights data because we only have 19 
variables, but you can still get the general idea:


```{r}
# Select columns by name
select(flights, year, month, day)
```


```{r}
# Select all columns between year and day (inclusive)
select(flights, year:day)

```


```{r}
# Select all columns except those from year to day (inclusive)
select(flights, -(year:day))
```

There are a number of helper functions you can use within `select()`:

* `starts_with("abc")`: matches names that begin with "abc".

* `ends_with("xyz")`: matches names that end with "xyz".

* `contains("ijk")`: matches names that contain "ijk".

* `matches("(.)\\1")`: selects variables that match a regular expression.
   This one matches any variables that contain repeated characters. You'll 
   learn more about regular expressions in [strings].
   
*  `num_range("x", 1:3)` matches `x1`, `x2` and `x3`.

## Mutate

Besides selecting sets of existing columns, it's often useful to add new columns
that are functions of existing columns. That's the job of `mutate()`.

`mutate()` always adds new columns at the end of your dataset so we'll start by 
creating a narrower dataset so we can see the new variables

```{r}
flights_sml <- select(flights, 
  year:day, 
  ends_with("delay"), 
  distance, 
  air_time
)
mutate(flights_sml,
  gain = arr_delay - dep_delay,
  speed = distance / air_time * 60
)
```

Note that you can refer to columns that you've just created:

```{r}
mutate(flights_sml,
  gain = arr_delay - dep_delay,
  hours = air_time / 60,
  gain_per_hour = gain / hours
)
```

If you only want to keep the new variables, use `transmute()`:

```{r}
transmute(flights,
  gain = arr_delay - dep_delay,
  hours = air_time / 60,
  gain_per_hour = gain / hours
)
```

## Useful creation functions

There are many functions for creating new variables that you can use with **mutate()**.

*   Arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`. These are all vectorised,
    using the so called "recycling rules". If one parameter is shorter than 
    the other, it will be automatically extended to be the same length. This 
    is most useful when one of the arguments is a single number: `air_time / 60`,
    `hours * 60 + minute`, etc.
    
    Arithmetic operators are also useful in conjunction with the aggregate
    functions you'll learn about later. For example, `x / sum(x)` calculates 
    the proportion of a total, and `y - mean(y)` computes the difference from 
    the mean.
    
*   Modular arithmetic: `%/%` (integer division) and `%%` (remainder), where
    `x == y * (x %/% y) + (x %% y)`. Modular arithmetic is a handy tool because 
    it allows you to break integers up into pieces. For example, in the 
    flights dataset, you can compute `hour` and `minute` from `dep_time` with:
    
    ```{r}
    transmute(flights,
      dep_time,
      hour = dep_time %/% 100,
      minute = dep_time %% 100
    )
    ```
    
Ranking: there are a number of ranking functions, but you should 
    start with `min_rank()`. It does the most usual type of ranking 
    (e.g. 1st, 2nd, 2nd, 4th). The default gives smallest values the small
    ranks; use `desc(x)` to give the largest values the smallest ranks. 
    
    ```{r}
    y <- c(1, 2, 2, NA, 3, 4)
    min_rank(y)
    min_rank(desc(y))
    ```
    
## Grouped summaries with `summarise()`

The last key verb is `summarise()`. It collapses a data frame to a single row:

```{r}
summarise(flights, delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```

`summarise()` is not terribly useful unless we pair it with `group_by()`. This 
changes the unit of analysis from the complete dataset to individual groups. 
Then, when you use the dplyr verbs on a grouped data frame they'll be 
automatically applied "by group". For example, if we applied exactly the same 
code to a data frame grouped by date, we get the average delay per date:

```{r}
by_day <- group_by(flights, year, month, day)
summarise(by_day, delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```
